## Executive Summary

As artificial intelligence and automation reshape the global economy, traditional economic models face unprecedented challenges. This report analyzes eight alternative economic frameworks that could create livable societies in the post-AI era, examining real-world examples, effectiveness evidence, scalability challenges, and adaptation potential for mass AI automation.

Key findings indicate that hybrid approaches combining Universal Basic Income, cooperative ownership structures, and commons-based production offer the most promising pathways forward. The evidence suggests that successful post-AI economies will likely blend multiple models rather than rely on single solutions.
