## üîó **Document Interconnections**

### **Positive ‚Üí Rogue Scenario Links**
- Economic models from Report #1 can prevent collapse scenarios in Report #7
- Governance innovations from Report #2 counter authoritarianism in Report #6
- Human purpose solutions from Report #3 address identity crisis in fragmentation (Report #5)
- Implementation guide from Report #4 provides timelines to prevent all rogue scenarios

### **Cross-Scenario Analysis**
- Reports #5-8 show how multiple failure modes interact and cascade
- Timeline convergence: 2025-2027 critical window appears across all analyses
- Probability interactions: Information warfare (85-90%) enables other scenarios

## üìà **Key Probability Findings**

| Scenario Type | Probability Range | Critical Timeline |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Information Warfare** | 85-90% | Already underway |
| **Elite AI Capture** | 80-85% | Already occurring |
| **Social Fragmentation** | 70-80% | By 2030 |
| **Techno-Authoritarianism** | 70-80% | 2025-2027 |
